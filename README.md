Halo, Yumiko desu.
This is a mini project about multi-robot system in Warehouse.
In this project, i simulated three case:
  - Single robot in Warehouse
  - Multi-robot system using model of Single robot in Warehouse (This case show that it should stuck)
  - Multi-robot system with lane separation and direction (It's not the best but it's quite good, i think :v)
