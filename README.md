<h1>Halo, Yumiko desu.</h1>
<div>This is a mini project about multi-robot system in Warehouse.</div>
<div>In this project, i simulated three case:</div> 
<ul>
  <li>Single robot in Warehouse</li>
  <li>Multi-robot system using model of Single robot in Warehouse (This case show that it should stuck)</li>
  <li>Multi-robot system with lane separation and direction (It's not the best but it's quite good, i think :v)</li>
</ul>
